More and more stundents switch from pen and paper to an iPad. However, when I just switched over to my iPad I felt a little lost. I did not which apps are actually useful and will improve my productivity and which are simply said, just a waste of space.<br>
So if you are just here for a quick overview: here you go

- [Settings](#settings)
- [Apps](#apps)
  - [1. Goodnotes](#1-goodnotes)
  - [2. Todoist](#2-todoist)


## Settings

 Let us cover some quick settings before we go ahead and install some apps. 

## Apps

### [1. Goodnotes](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1444383602)

Goodnotes is for me an absolute essential. Not only because it is a feature-rich and easy-to-use note taking app which works excellent with the Apple Pencil but also because it is widely used and therefore, great for collobaration.<br>
This year the Goodnotes developers decided to remove the paywall and use a freemium model. In other words you can download the app right away and start taking notes. However, if you would like to support the developers and unlock all features, I highly recommend the pro version. 

### [2. Todoist](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-task-manager/id572688855)
