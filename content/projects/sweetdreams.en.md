This is my plan on how to achieve a healthy sleep rhythm. To specify this more precisly here is what I mean by this: get in bed by 9 pm and wake up by 5 am. 
I hope to achive this by following steps: 

# 1. Get your tasks done

- create a todo-list by hand on paper
  - make sure to check complete tasks
- use the pomodoro method to learn
  - mix different subjects
  - add pe and playing the piano after long tasks
